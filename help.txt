NAME:
  ncmpcpp-lyrics - Add lyrics to your music library. Compatible with ncmpcpp
 music player.

SYNOPSIS:
  ncmpcpp-lyrics [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] [LYRICS DIR] -a [ACCESS TOKEN FILE PATH]
  ncmpcpp-lyrics [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] -a [ACCESS TOKEN FILE PATH] [LYRICS DIR]
  ncmpcpp-lyrics -a [ACCESS TOKEN FILE PATH] [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] [LYRICS DIR]

DESCRIPTION:
   Iterate [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] recursively and extract all paths to mp3 files.
  From each mp3 file (from its file name) extract
  author and title properties and using the Genius API fetch lyrics (only if
  they do not already exist in [LYRICS DIR]). Save the lyrics to [LYRICS DIR]
  in format '{author} - {title}.txt', the format used by the ncmpcpp music
  player to read and write lyrics.

   In order for this little CLI program to be able to fetch lyrics from the
  Genius API, you need to provide it with a text file containing ACCESS_TOKEN
  that you can obtain from https://genius.com/api-clients and set via the
  --access-token-file flag

   [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] must contain mp3 files with file names describing
  data like the title and author of the piece in format:
  '{author} - {whatever you want} - {however you want} - {title}.mp3'
   The only two requirements are that the file name starts with the
  author of the song, separated from other metadata you might (or might not)
  want to include with a dash (' - ') and ends with the title
  of the musical piece.
  
FLAGS:

  -a, --access-token-file
    Path to a file containing in plain text access token for the Genius API
